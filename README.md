### Hello there :) ðŸ‘‹

I'm Audrey Lam, and I am currently a first-year majoring in **bold**Computer Science at UCI! 
I'm currently taking Intermediate Programming (ICS 33), Intro to Probability and Statistics for Computer Science (STATS 67), and Introduction to Software Engineering (IN4MATX 43). 

I am interested in a career in software development, but I am also curious about other topics, such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
